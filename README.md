# 🧠 Ronsum's Brainfuck Projects

Welcome to the **digital dungeon of absurd logic** — a place where reason dies and `+` is mightier than the sword.

This repository is my personal vault of **Brainfuck experiments**, created to explore just how far you can push an esoteric language made of 8 characters and pure pain.

## 🚀 What is Brainfuck?

> Brainfuck is a minimalist, Turing-complete programming language created in 1993. It uses only 8 commands:

It’s designed to break your brain and teach you patience.

## 📂 Projects

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Hello_World.bf` | Prints `Hello World` (No comma — because I'm not a sheep.) |
| `Hello_World_Optimized.bf` | Prints `Hello World but in 2 bytes of memory` (No comma — because I'm not a sheep.) |

> ⚠️ More unholy creations coming soon.

## 🧪 How to Run

### ✅ Using Online Interpreter
Paste the code into [https://copy.sh/brainfuck/](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/) or any Brainfuck playground.

### 🐍 Using Python (if you dare)
```bash
python bf_interpreter.py hello-world.bf

🌌 Why?
Because I wanted to suffer.
Because C was too easy.
Because my neurons needed a workout.
Because sometimes, you just want to print “Hello World” by incrementing a cell 72 times.
